# Olympe - Python controller library for Parrot Drones

Olympe provides a Python controller programming interface for Parrot Drone. You can use Olympe to
connect and control a drone from a remote Python script executed from your computer.
Olympe is primarily intended to be used with a simulated drone (using Sphinx, the Parrot drone
simulator) but may also be used to connect to physical drones. Like GroundSDK-iOS and
GroundSDK-Android, Olympe is based on arsdk-ng/arsdk-xml.

Olympe is part of the [Parrot Ground SDK](https://developer.parrot.com/) which allows any developer
to create its own mobile or desktop application for ANAFI, ANAFI Thermal and ANAFI AI drones.
