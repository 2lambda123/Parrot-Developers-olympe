# Olympe - Python controller library for Parrot Drones

Olympe provides a Python controller programming interface for Parrot Drone. This means you can use
Olympe to connect and control a drone from a remote Python script executed from your computer.
Olympe is primarily intended to be used with a simulated drone (using Sphinx, the Parrot drone
simulator) but may also be used to connect to physical drones. Like GroundSDK-iOS and
GroundSDK-Android, Olympe is based on arsdk-ng/arsdk-xml.
